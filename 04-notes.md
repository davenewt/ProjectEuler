# Problem 4: Largest Palindrome

> A palindromic number reads the same both ways.

> The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## Workings

### Method 1

Started by thinking that as we need to find the **largest** palindrome, we should simply start testing with `a x b` = `999 * 999`, decrease `b` until `b = a`, whereupon we decrease `a` and reset `b` to `999`. Then, when we find a palindrome, we're done:

- 999 x 999
- 998 x 999, 998 x 998
- 997 x 999, 997 x 998, 997 x 997
- 996 x 999, 996 x 998, 996 x 997, 996 x 996
- 995 x 999... and so on...

But this doesn't work, because we don't get results in decreasing order of their **product**:

```
Results from first batch of calculations

Investigating 999x999 998001
Investigating 998x999 997002
Investigating 998x998 996004
Investigating 997x999 996003
Investigating 997x998 995006
Investigating 997x997 994009
Investigating 996x999 995004 <--- this is larger than the result above! Won't work!
```

### Method 2

This got me thinking along another tack. Doing the calculations `a * b` in decreasing order of the **sum** of the two numbers (`a + b`) should work:

```
Results from first batch of calculations re-ordered
depending on their product  ------\/

Investigating 999x999 998001 --- 1998
Investigating 998x999 997002 --- 1997
Investigating 998x998 996004 --- 1996
Investigating 997x999 996003 --- 1996
Investigating 997x998 995006 --- 1995
Investigating 996x999 995004 --- 1995 <--- this calculation is now done before...
Investigating 997x997 994009 --- 1994      ...this one!
```

## Chosen Method

Because I couldn't quite work out how to programatically implement Method 2, I ended up using the 'lazy' Method 1: Running through all calculations using numbers between 100 and 999, storing any found palindromes in an array. Turns out this was pretty quick way of finding all 1,239 palindrome results... although I'm sure Method 2 would be faster.

I then sorted the resulting array into another array, being careful to use a [compare function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) (to make sure all numbers were sorted **numerically**) and then looked at the largest result, which was the last item in the final sorted array.

## Potential Improvements

- [ ] It would be good to figure out how to do the initial calculation of `a * b` in order of decreasing sum (`a + b`), so that when the first palindrome is found, we know it's the largest we're going to find. Not yet wrapped my head around how to do this!

- [ ] My method of deciding if a number is palindromic is over-complicated! I should just check if the number matches its reverse form!
